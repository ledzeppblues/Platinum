    <p>Ladies up in here tonight
        No fighting
        We got the refugees up in here (no fighting)
        No fighting
        SHAKIRA, SHAKIRA
        I never really knew that she could dance like this (hey)
        She make a man wants to speak Spanish
        ¿Cómo se llama? (Sí), bonita (sí)
        Mi casa, su casa (Shakira, Shakira)
        Oh, baby, when you talk like that
        You make a woman go mad
        So be wise (sí) and keep on (sí)
        Reading the signs of my body (uno, dos, tres, cuatro)
        I'm on tonight
        You know my hips don't lie (no fighting)
        And I'm starting to feel it's right
        All the attraction, the tension
        Don't you see, baby, this is perfection?
        Hey, girl, I can see your body moving
        And it's driving me crazy
        And I didn't have the slightest idea
        Until I saw you dancing (yeah)
        And when you walk up on the dance floor
        Nobody cannot ignore the way you move your body, girl (just move)
        And everything so unexpected, the way you right and left it
        So you can keep on shaking it (let's go)
        I never really knew that she could dance like this
        She make a man wants to speak Spanish
        ¿Cómo se llama? (Sí), bonita (sí)
        Mi casa, su casa (Shakira, Shakira)
        Oh, baby, when you talk like that
        You make a woman go mad
        So be wise (sí) and keep on (sí)
        Reading the signs of my body (no fighting)
        I'm on tonight
        You know my hips don't lie (no fighting)
        And I am starting to feel you, boy
        Come on, let's go, real slow
        Don't you see, baby, así es perfecto?
        They know I am on tonight, my hips don't lie
        And I'm starting to feel it's right
        All the attraction, the tension
        Don't you see, baby, this is perfection? (Shakira, Shakira)
        Oh, boy, I can see your body moving
        Half animal, half man
        I don't, don't really know what I'm doing
        But you seem to have a plan
        My will and self-restraint
        Have come to fail now, fail now
        See, I am doing what I can, but I can't so you know
        That's a bit too hard to explain (uno, dos, tres, cuatro)
        Baila en la calle de noche (yeah)
        Baila en la calle de día (let's go)
        Baila en la calle de noche
        Baila en la calle de día
        I never really knew that she could dance like this
        She make a man wants to speak Spanish
        ¿Cómo se llama? (Sí), bonita (sí)
        Mi casa, su casa (Shakira, Shakira)
        Oh, baby, when you talk like that
        You know you got me hypnotized
        So be wise (sí) and keep on (sí)
        Reading the signs of my body
        Señorita, feel the conga
        Let me see you move like you come from Colombia
        Yeah (ladies sí) (yeah yeah)
        (Hey, yeah)
        ¡Mira en Barranquilla se baila así, say it! (yeah)
        En Barranquilla se baila así (yeah)
        Hey, brra!
        Yeah, she's so sexy, every man's fantasy
        A refugee like me back with the Fugees from a third world country
        I go back like when 'Pac carried crates for Humpty Humpty
        We leave the whole club dizzy
        Why the CIA wanna watch us?
        Colombians and Haitians
        I ain't guilty, it's a musical transaction
        Bo bop so bop, no more do we snatch ropes
        Refugees run the seas 'cause we own our own boats (no fighting)
        I'm on tonight, my hips don't lie
        And I'm starting to feel you, boy
        Come on, let's go, real slow
        Baby, like this is perfecto (no fighting)
        Oh, you know I'm on tonight, my hips don't lie
        And I am starting to feel it's right
        The attraction, the tension
        Baby, like this is perfection
        No fighting
        No fighting</p>
